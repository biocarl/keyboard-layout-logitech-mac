# keyboard-layout-logitech-mac

This is for me to have a consistent layout for key between mac and windows.

Be aware for the option keys to use you need to select the IntelliJ idea classic keymap in IntelliJ

Edit this file with Ukulele (see tils)

```plaintext
The .keylayout files may be installed by copying them to the Keyboard Layouts folder within /Library or ~/Library; then they are enabled via the Input Sources (Input in 10.5 and earlier) tab of the Keyboard (Language & Text in 10.9 and earlier, International in 10.5 and earlier) module within System Preferences.
```
